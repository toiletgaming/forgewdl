World Downloader Mod as a Minecraft Forge 1.12.2 mod

This version in particular draws the chunk that you have downloaded. To remove this, delete custom_ChunkRenderer.java, IRenderManager.java and MixinRenderManager.java, including everything that touches these classes.

* Pokechu22 - for original World Downloader mod
* Future Client developers - for making it a Forge mod
* 086 - for KAMI code I used
